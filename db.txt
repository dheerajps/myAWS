DynamoDB

Stored on SSD storage
-Eventual Consistent
-Strongly Consistent
You cannot select a specific Availability Zone in which to place your DynamoDB Table.
Tables
Items -> ROW
Attributes -> COLUMNS

Pricing is by Throughput AND Storage

Primary Key:
-- Single Attribute (Partition Key)
-- Composite (Partition Key and Sort Key)

Indexes:
Local Secondary Index
--(Same partition Key, different sort key)
-- Created at Table Creation
Global Secondary Index
--(Different partition Key, different sort key)
-- Create at or after Table Creation

Streams:
Use to capture any modification of the DynamoDB table
Stored for 24 hours
You can use triggers to handle these streams

Query:
Finds using only primary key. Optionally sort key attribute can be provided.

ProjectionExpression can be used to restrict number of attributes/specific attributes returned.
By default sorted by sortKey. Else by Ascending Order. If needed to be changed use ScanIndexForward to false

Scan:
Basically dumping the whole table

Query is better than for Scan. Obvious reasons
DynamoDB does not support complex relational queries (e.g. joins) or complex transactions.

You can specify an expression as part of the Query API call to filter results based on values of primary keys on a table using the KeyConditionExpression parameter. 

Conditional Updates - Idempotent
Atomic Counters

BatchWriteItem ?? -- The BatchWriteItem operation puts or deletes multiple items in one or more tables. When called in a loop, it also checks for unprocessed items and submits a new BatchWriteItem request with those unprocessed items until all items have been processed.

Provisioned Throughput Limits can be requested to increase via a limit

Which API call would you use to query an item by its primary key? GetItem

True or false: DynamoDB supports cross-table joins. -- False

DynamoDB uses optimistic concurrency control. T/F -- True

In DynamoDB, what is the maximum length of a partition key value? -- 2048 bytes
The minimum length of a sort key value is 1 byte. The maximum length is 1024 bytes
DynamoDB supports nested attributes up to 32 levels deep.

Although GETS, UPDATES, and DELETES of items in Dynamo DB consume capacity units, updating the table via the UpdateTable API call consumes no capacity units. -- True. Although it accounts for the throughput

BatchGetItem - A single BatchGetItem operation can retrieve a maximum of 100 items. The total size of all the items retrieved cannot exceed 16 MB.
BatchWriteItem - A single BatchWriteItem operation can contain up to 25 PutItem or DeleteItem requests. The total size of all the items written cannot exceed 16 MB.

One DynamoDB read capacity unit is equal to one strongly consistent read per second T/F. -- True

Dynamo use Eventual read consistency which is default

A composite key comprising hash and range keys is the same thing as a composite key comprising partition and sort keys.

Which of the following DynamoDB API calls does not consume capacity units? UpdateTable

True or False: You can define a maximum of 5 local secondary indexes and 5 global secondary indexes per DynamoDB table. -- True. No increase request allowed.

What is the primary advantage of a conditional write? -- With a conditional write, an operation succeeds only if the item attributes meet one or more expected conditions.

Which of the following DynamoDB write operations allow conditional writes? -- Update, Put, Delete Item

True or False: While the UpdateTable operation is executing, the table status changes from ACTIVE to UPDATING, and you cannot issue another UpdateTable request until the table returns to the ACTIVE state. -- True

The numbers of S3 buckets per account and DynamoDB tables per account can be increased by AWS Support. --  256 tables per user/ per region. -- 100 buckets per user

What is the maximum limit for size of an item ? -- 400kb

The result set from a Scan and a Query is limited to 1 MB per call. You can use the LastEvaluatedKey from the scan response to retrieve more results.

Smallest amount of reserved capacity that can be purchased? -- 100 units

Control plane operations let you create and manage DynamoDB tables. They also let you work with indexes, streams, and other objects that are dependent on tables. In contrast, Data plane operations let you perform create, read, update, and delete (also called CRUD) actions on data in a table

A single DynamoDB table partition can support a maximum of 3,000 read capacity units or 1,000 write capacity units. When you create a new table, the initial number of partitions can be expressed as follows:(readCapacityUnits / 3,000 ) + ( writeCapacityUnits / 1,000 ) = initialPartitions (rounded up)

Although all reads from a DynamoDB table are eventually consistent by default, strongly consistent reads can be specified.

IncompleteSignature and InvalidParameterValue will return an HTTP Status code of 400. The other will return an HTTP status code of 403.
