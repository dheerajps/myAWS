DNS:

Domain Name Server. Look up IP addresses.
An ELB only has dns name, not IP address.
TTL - how long the dns record after a request is cached locally. Lower TTL makes the changes to dns records take faster to propagate.
Cname: canonical name. Can be used to resolve one domain name to another.

Choose Alias record over cname( cheaper as well as maps to naked domain name)

Always must have NS records and Start Of Authority Records for any record set
5 types of routing policies. Simple, Weighted, Latency, Failover, Geolocation

VPC:
Virtual Data Centre in the cloud.
Easily customizable
VPC Diagram. 1 internet gateway per vpc only.
VPC peering. No transitive peering allowed.

Subnets are not created when a VPC is created unlike, route tables, NACLS, Security Groups.When you create new subnets within a custom VPC, by default they can communicate with each other, across availability zones.
On subnet level NACL will act as a firewall, on an instance level SG will act as a firewall.
Add an elastic IP address to the new instance if it cannot access internet from a subnet
Security groups don't span across vpc's.

NAT Instances:
You can get it from community ami
NAT instance vs NAT Gateways. FAQs

NACLs vs SG:
A ACL can be associated with many subnets.
Each subnet in the VPC must be associated with one NACL, if not it gets a default.
1 internet gateway can be attached to a custom vpc.

VPC Flow Logs:
Logging network traffic

Both VPC and Auto-Scaling services are offered at no direct cost. Charges will be incurred, however, for the underlying compute or storage resources.

By default, how many Elastic IP addresses are you limited to per region? -- 5

There can be only 1 Route table per subnet

All subnets in an AmazonVPC have routes to all other subnets

You can have 200 subnets / vpc
