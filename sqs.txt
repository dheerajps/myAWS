Message queue service, to store messages while waiting for another service to consume/process them.

A queue is a temporary repository to store messages.

Messages can be of size up to 256KB.

Queue can handle auto scaling as well failover.
Helps in decoupling.
- Max number of domains per account 100
- Visibility Time out : 30s(default) - 12hours.
- The minimum visibility timeout for an SQS message is 0 seconds. There is no way to decrease that value.
ChangeMessageVisibilty API.
- Can offer FIFO queues. Messages are delivered exactly once.
- Max retention time of an sqs message - 14days. Default is 4 days
- Billing according to 64kb chunks. 256kb message is treated as 4 requests
- Long polling is better than short polling. 20s default maximum
- An SQS message can be delivered multiple times.
- Batch operations (SendMessageBatch, DeleteMessageBatch, and ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch) all cost the same as other Amazon SQS requests.
- PurgeQueue - to clear the SQS message queue all at once
- SentTimestamp attribute can be used to calculate time-in-queue value.

SNS:

Send notifications from cloud.
Pub sub messaging paradigm

No polling required
SNS - Push
SQS - Pull

Topic is a subject. Anything published to the topic will send messages to the subscribers.
You can delete an individual subscriber
JSON formatted
ChangeMessageVisibility - to extend the length of time to process the jobs
Subscribers can be - Email, HTTPS, HTTP, SQS, Email json
You can customize protocol type for SNS messages.
Tokens sent for subscription confirmation is valid for 3 days

SWF:
Makes it easy to work across distributed application components. By co-ordinating tasks.

Worker and a decider will help in the workflow.
Humans cannot make decisions
A task is assigned only once to a worker.
1yr max task retention time.
Task oriented service unlike message oriented.
Synchronous. Delivery order guaranteed.

Elastic Beanstalk:
It provisions aws resources.
Free.

CloudFormation:
- Free. IaaS or IaaC
- Helps to provision and also provides version to the infrastructure.
- No restriction on number of templates.
	200 stacks per account can be requested for increase.
	60 Parameters / Outputs per template.
- if Cloud Formation encounters an error. It will terminate and rollback all resources created on failure. You are charged for errors.

- Invalid JSON syntax will cause an error message during template validation. Since the stack will never start creating, there is nothing to roll back

- Example Mapping : { "Fn::FindInMap" : [ "RegionMap", { "Ref" : "AWS::Region" }, "32"]}

To output data:
Fn:GetAtt

WaitCondition is supported to have stacks to wait while creation.

There is no limit to the number of CloudFormation Templates per Region.

Shared Responsibility Model:
--Infrastructure Services
--Container Services
--Abstracted Services (ex: dynamodb, s3, lambda)

The visibility timeout is the time during which the message is invisible to workers. If this interval is set to '0', the message will be immediately available for processing.

Which section of a CloudFormation template allows you to set up differing instance types based on environment type (e.g. 'Production' or 'QA')? -- Conditions
The Resources section is the only required section. It specifies the stack resources and their properties.

True or False: an SQS request can contain up to 20 individual messages, as long as the total size of the request does not exceed 256KB. -- False. 10. 

True or False: in addition to XML, JSON, and unformatted text, an SQS message may contain certain Unicode characters. -- True

Your EC2 instance receives a message from SQS and the visibility timeout begins. Which API operation must be called to prevent the message from becoming visible again? DeleteMessage

True or False: The failure of an Availability Zone will result in the loss of an SNS message originating in that AZ. -- False. Failover of az's will kick in

While working with the SQS API, your application returns HTTP status code 400. Which of the following errors might explain this result? -- MissingAction and MissingParameter would return a 400 HTTP status code. The others would return a 403.

To send messages larger than 256 KB, you can use the Amazon SQS Extended Client Library for Java. This library allows you to send an Amazon SQS message that contains a reference to a message payload in Amazon S3.

How many message queues in sqs ? -- unlimited

In an sqs message: Has following items - Name, type, value, message body (None of them can Null)

Software can be installed during stack creation process of CF. -- True. AWS provides bootstrapping scripts which can be run
